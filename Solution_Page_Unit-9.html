                                OOP offers easy to understand and a clear modular structure for programs.

                                Objects created for Object-Oriented Programs can be reused in other 
                                programs. Thus, it saves significant development cost.

                                Large programs are difficult to write, but if the development and designing 
                                team follow OOPS concept then they can better design with minimum flaws.

                                It also enhances program modularity because every object exists

                            <li>
                                The OOP programs design is tricky. Object Oriented programs require a lot 
                                of work to create. Specifically, a great deal of planning goes into an object 
                                oriented program well before a single piece of code is ever written. Initially, 
                                this early effort was felt by many to be a waste of time. In addition, because 
                                the programs were larger coders spent more time actually writing the 
                                program.                                
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Object Oriented programs are slower than other programs, partially because 
                                of their size. Other aspects of Object Oriented Programs also demand more 
                                system resources, thus slowing the program down.

                                All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed

                    <p>
                        There are 4 major principles of the object orientation: <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Encapsulation: </strong><br>
                                Encapsulation is all about binding the data variable and functions 
                                together in class.<br>   
                                <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                                &bull; The driver interacts with the car through the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons (public methods).<br>
                                <br>
                                &bull; The driver doesn't need to know how the engine works internally (private data and methods); they just need to press the start button (public method) to get the car running.<br>
                                <br>
                                &bull; The engine and internal mechanisms are hidden (private) from the driver to prevent tampering or misuse.<br>
                            </li>
                            <br>

                                <strong>Data Abstraction: </strong><br>
                                Abstraction means, showcasing only the required things to the outside world 
                                while hiding the details.<br>
                                <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                                &bull; User Interaction (Abstracted Details): When you use an ATM, you simply insert your card, enter your PIN, and select options like withdrawing cash or checking your balance.<br>
                                <br>
                                &bull; Internal Complexity (Hidden Details): The complex processes such as verifying your account, communicating with the bank's server, checking your balance, and dispensing the correct amount of cash are abstracted from you.<br>
                                <br>
                                &bull; Why Abstraction? You don't need to know how the machine communicates with the bank or how it verifies your account. You just see the interface (screen and buttons) and interact with it to get what you need.<br>

                                The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it 
                                refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be 
                                executed on many objects or classes. <br>

                                        An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is 
                                        the len() function.

                                    <li>
                                        For dictionaries len() returns the number of key/value pairs in the 
                                        dictionary:

                                        Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have

                                Inheritance promotes reusability. When a class inherits or derives another 
                                class, it can access all the functionality of inherited class.

                                Reusability enhanced reliability. The base class code will be already tested 
                                and debugged.

                            <li>
                                As the existing code is reused, it leads to less development and maintenance 
                                costs.

                                Inherited function work slower than normal function as there is indirection.

                                Often, data members in the base class are left unused which may lead to memory wastage.

                                Inheritance increases the coupling between base class and derived class. A 
                                change in base class will affect all the child classes.

                        Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single 
                        parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features 
                        to existing code.

                        1. Overriding means having two methods with the same name but doing 
                        different tasks. It means that one of the methods overrides the other. <br>
                        <br>
                        2. If there is any method in the super class and a method with the same 
                        name in subclass, then by executing the method, the method of the 
                        corresponding class will be executed.
